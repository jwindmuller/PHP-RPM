# Working with RPM's API with PHP

This is a code example that shows how to have a contact form in a website that stores the data in RPM.


## Setting up

1. Create the Contact Process in RPM using the the template called Contact.xml (take note of the Process ID assigned).
2. Rename code/ApiConfig.sample.php to code/ApiConfig.php and fill with your RPM Subscription information and the process ID for the Contact process.
